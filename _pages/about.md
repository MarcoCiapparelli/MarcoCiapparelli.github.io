Hi, my name is Marco Ciapparelli, and I'm a researcher in cognitive science. I combine computational modeling with behavioral and neuroimaging data to study how humans learn, represent, and combine concepts. Because machines have gotten quite good at that, I'm also interested in studying how they do it.

Short bio
======
I am currently a postdoc at the University of Milano-Bicocca working with [Carlo Reverberi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TeyiNGIAAAAJ&hl=en) on the neural correlates (fMRI) of conceptual combination in language and vision modalities. I received my PhD in Psychology, Linguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Milano-Bicocca, where I worked on computational models of conceptual combination with [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net/). During my PhD, I spent a visiting period at the [Thompson-Schill lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/schill-lab/) at UPenn, where I investigated how the alignment of language and vision may aid zero-shot learning of novel concepts. Before my PhD, I completed my MS and BS in Psychology at the University of Milano-Bicocca.
